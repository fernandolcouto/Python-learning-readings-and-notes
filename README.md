# Introduction

The large amount of access to information implies the need to keep the collection of data sources organized.
Although with limitations, initially, the "Favorites" feature of the browser proved to be a viable option, as it allows you to store links in folders and subfolders. Searches can be separated into "Read", "Unread", as well as categorize them by Sources such as: Scientific Articles, Blog Posts, Video Content, etc.
Nevertheless, a persistent limitation of this resource (Browser Favorites) is the need to keep the assimilated content (learning) together with the information from the research source. A link to the source and another to the content produced fragments the learning process and this fragmentation helps to disperse and slow the absorption of knowledge.
Thus, the problem to be solved consists of building, or finding, a single place to store all the research content keeping concise notes, images, codes, mathematical formulas, hypotheses and any and all content produced from contact with particular data source.

# Solution (test)

Fortunately, the GitHub framework already provides a relatively simple solution, as shown in Article "https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-organize-your-data-science-articles-with-github-b5b9427dad37", which points to the "https://github.com/khuyentran1401/machine-learning-articles" repository.
In the Article, the author discusses solutions that already exist and discusses ways of using the "Issues" feature of GitHub. Follow the links.


# Initial Proposal for the Use of this Repository

Container for storing readings and notes in the Python learning process.
